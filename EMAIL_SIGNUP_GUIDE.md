## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is Google OAuth failing?**
A: Google OAuth error "Authentication failed" usually means the Google Client ID isn't configured correctly in Google Cloud Console. But you don't need it - email/password works perfectly!

**Q: Can users reset their password?**
A: Yes! There's a "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in page.

**Q: Is the email verified?**
A: The backend has email verification built in, but it's not blocking login.

**Q: Can I disable Google OAuth button?**
A: It's already showing as "temporarily unavailable" after the first failed attempt.
